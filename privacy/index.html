  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">App: <strong>Veloria (Inspiration Dressing)</strong> — Package: <code>com.aznablemiao.veloria</code> — Last updated: 2025-12-10</p>

  <p>Welcome to Veloria. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, and the choices you have regarding your information.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We may collect and process the following types of information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Information you provide directly:</strong> such as profile details, feedback, and any content (text, photos) you upload.</li>
    <li><strong>Device and usage information:</strong> technical data about your device and app usage (e.g., device model, OS version, crash logs, usage metrics) to improve app performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Data related to permissions:</strong> if you enable certain features, we may access related data (for example, photos or camera images). See the Permissions section below.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Permissions & How We Use Them</h2>
  <p>The app may request the following sensitive permissions only when you enable the related feature:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera (android.permission.CAMERA)</strong> — used to take photos for outfit reference or style capture. Requested only when you choose the camera option.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage (READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE / WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)</strong> — used to read or save images and cache files when required by your device/Android version.</li>
    <li><strong>Microphone (RECORD_AUDIO)</strong> — used only if you enable voice input or recording features.</li>
    <li><strong>Location (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION / ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)</strong> — used optionally for location-based recommendations if you opt in.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="note">Important: Permissions are requested on an opt-in basis. If you deny a permission, the related feature will not work but the app's core functionality remains available.</p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide, maintain, and improve the app and its features (e.g., personalized recommendations).</li>
    <li>To diagnose and fix technical issues and monitor app performance.</li>
    <li>To communicate with you about updates, support requests, or important notices.</li>
    <li>To detect and prevent fraud, abuse, or other illegal activity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing & Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We may share necessary information with trusted third-party service providers to operate our app, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>App distribution platforms (e.g., Google Play).</li>
    <li>Analytics and crash-reporting services (e.g., Firebase Analytics) if enabled — these services process aggregated or pseudonymized data to help us improve the app.</li>
    <li>Cloud hosting or storage providers used to store your content when you choose to back up or sync.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We require third parties to process data only as instructed and to implement reasonable security measures. If you use features that integrate with specific third-party SDKs (e.g., ads or social logins), we recommend listing those SDKs and linking to their privacy policies on this page.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy or to comply with legal obligations. When you request deletion of your data, we will delete or anonymize personal data within a reasonable timeframe unless retention is required by law.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Manage permissions:</strong> You can grant or revoke app permissions in your device settings at any time. Revoking permissions may affect certain features.</li>
    <li><strong>Access and deletion:</strong> You may contact us to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data. For account deletion requests, please visit our <a href="/delete-account">Account Deletion page</a> for detailed instructions.</li>
    <li><strong>Marketing communications:</strong> If you opt into promotional messages, you can unsubscribe via links in emails or by contacting us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Children</h2>
  <p>Our app is not designed for children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without parental consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:{{YOUR_EMAIL}}">{{YOUR_EMAIL}}</a> and we will take steps to remove such data.</p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access and disclosure (for example, access controls and encryption when appropriate). However, no internet transmission or storage system is completely secure.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When material changes occur we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page and, where appropriate, notify you via the app. Please review this page periodically.</p>
